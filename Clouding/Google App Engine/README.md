Google App Engine lets you run your web applications on Google's infrastructure. App Engine applications are easy to build, maintain and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs grow. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain, you just upload your application, and it's ready to serve your users.

You can serve your app from your own domain name (such as http://www.example.com/ ) using Google Apps. Or, you can serve your app using a free name on the appspot.com domain. You can share your application with the world, or limit access to members of your organization.
Google App Engine supports apps written in several programming languages. With App Engine's Java runtime environment, you can build your app using standard Java technologies including the JVM, Java servlets, and the Java programming languageâ€”or any other language using a JVM-based interpreter or compiler, such as JavaScript or Ruby. App Engine also features a dedicated Python runtime environment, which includes a fast Python interpreter and the Python standard library. The Java and Python runtime environments are built to ensure that your application runs quickly, securely, and without interference with other apps on the system.

With App Engine, you only pay for what you use. There are no set-up costs and no recurring fees. The resources your application uses, such as storage and bandwidth, are measured in gigabyte, and billed at competitive rates. You control the maximum amount of resources your app can consume, so it always stays within your budget.

App Engine costs nothing to get started. All applications can use up to 500 MB of storage and enough CPU and bandwidth to support an efficient app serving around 5 million page views a month, absolutely free. When you enable billing for your application, your free limits are raised and you only pay for resources you use above the free levels.
